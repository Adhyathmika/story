Snow White and seven Dwarf

Intro :
The Dwarfs wanted to protect the beautiful princess from
 the evil queen, so they invited Snow White to live with 
them. To celebrate, the new friends sang and danced the
 night away. Back at the castle, the Queen learned that 
Snow White was still alive. Enraged, she made a magic
 potion to change her appearance.
